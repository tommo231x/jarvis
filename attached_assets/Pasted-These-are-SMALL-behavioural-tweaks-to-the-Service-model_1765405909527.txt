These are SMALL behavioural tweaks to the Service model and New Service form.
Please do NOT treat this as a big refactor.

FOCUS: next bill date validation and automatic rollover based on billing cycle.

1) NEXT BILL DUE VALIDATION (CREATE + EDIT)

We already have a `nextBillingDate` (or "Next bill due") field on the Service.

I want the following behaviour when creating or editing a Service:

- If the user provides a `nextBillingDate`:
  - It must be today or a future date.
  - If it is in the past (before today), show a validation error in the form and prevent submit.
    - Example error message: “Next bill due must be today or a future date.”

- If the user leaves `nextBillingDate` empty:
  - That’s allowed (field is optional).
  - Do not auto-generate a date on create; just store it as null/undefined.

Please implement this validation:
- On the client side in the New Service / Edit Service form.
- And also enforce it server-side in the relevant API handler so invalid data cannot be saved via API calls.

2) ROLLOVER LOGIC FOR NEXT BILL DATE

I want `nextBillingDate` to move forward over time based on the billing cycle, **as long as the service is active or trial**.

We already have a billing cycle field (e.g. "monthly", "yearly", etc). Use whatever enum or string values we already have configured.

Implement a small utility (or functions) something like:

- `getNextBillingDate(currentDate, billingCycle)`:
  - Given a Date and a cycle ("monthly", "yearly", etc),
  - returns a new Date moved forward by one cycle.
  - e.g. monthly = +1 month; yearly = +1 year.

- `ensureFutureBillingDate(service)`:
  - If `service.nextBillingDate` is set AND
  - `service.status` is "active" or "trial":
    - While `nextBillingDate` is before today:
      - move it forward one cycle using `getNextBillingDate`.
    - Save or return the updated service.

For now, I’m OK with you calling this rollover logic in whichever place is simplest, for example:
- Before returning services to any “upcoming bills” / “subscriptions” view, or
- In a periodic job/function if we already have one.

Key behaviour in plain language:

- As long as a service is `active` or `trial`, its `nextBillingDate` keeps jumping forward in billingCycle steps until it’s in the future.
- If the status is `cancelled` or `archived`, do NOT roll the date forward anymore.

3) STATUS HANDLING (NO BIG CHANGES)

The valid statuses currently include `active`, `trial`, `cancelled`, `archived` (and possibly others like `inactive`).

Do NOT change the statuses in the data model right now.

However:

- Make sure the rollover logic only runs for:
  - `status === "active"` or `status === "trial"`.
- For `cancelled` and `archived`, `nextBillingDate` should remain whatever it was; do not move it forward.

4) QUICK SANITY CHECKS AFTER IMPLEMENTATION

After you’ve implemented these changes, please:

- Confirm:
  - I cannot save a Service with `nextBillingDate` in the past.
  - I can still save a Service with no `nextBillingDate`.
- Demonstrate (in your summary) that:
  - For an `active` monthly service whose `nextBillingDate` was yesterday, your helper moves it forward to next month.
  - For a `cancelled` or `archived` service, `nextBillingDate` stays unchanged.

Also, please list the files you changed at the end of your work.
