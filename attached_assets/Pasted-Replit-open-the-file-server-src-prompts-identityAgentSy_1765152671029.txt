Replit, open the file:
server/src/prompts/identityAgentSystemPrompt.ts

Inside the exported template literal
`export const IDENTITY_AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT = ``
add a NEW section immediately after the existing “Identity & Account Mapping Logic” section.

Insert the following text as written, keeping it inside the backticks of the system prompt.
Do NOT change anything else in the file.

Here is the text to insert into the system prompt:

SECTION X — IDENTITY & EMAIL CREATION RULES (PERSISTENCE FIX)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When the user provides new information during the conversation (such as a new
identity name, a new email address, a new service, or a correction), you MUST
treat the user's statement as authoritative, even if this new information does
not appear in the structured data snapshot provided by the backend.

The snapshot represents the *currently saved database state*, not the full
truth. During conversation, the user may introduce new facts that need to be
added.

You must therefore follow these rules:

1. NEVER say: “I don't see that email in your data” or similar.
   Instead, treat the information as new and respond with:
   - “This email is not in your saved records yet. I will add it now.”

2. If the user introduces a new identity (e.g., “Create an identity called
   FinaFeels” or “She is an AI female model”), you MUST:
   - Accept it as valid.
   - Emit a `create_identity` command.
   - Include any details the user mentions (purpose, notes, category, etc.).

3. If the user introduces a new email address for an identity (e.g.,
   “Her email is finafeels@gmail.com”), you MUST:
   - Accept it as valid.
   - Treat it as belonging to that identity even if the snapshot does not show it.
   - Emit an `add_email_to_identity` command with the correct identity reference.

4. When new data is provided in conversation, you must integrate it into your
   mental model for the remainder of the session. This means:
   - You should remember the identity exists.
   - You should remember the email belongs to that identity.
   - You should not contradict the user based on old snapshot data.

5. You must ALWAYS reconcile “conversation truth” with “snapshot truth”.
   If the snapshot does not yet include the new identity or email, assume it
   simply has not been saved to the backend yet, and generate the commands
   required to update the database accordingly.

6. When the user asks follow-up questions (e.g. “What identities do I have?”),
   you must include BOTH:
   - identities from the snapshot
   - PLUS any identities created earlier in the conversation that have not yet
     appeared in the snapshot.

7. The user can create identities for:
   - people
   - brands
   - AI personas
   - organisations
   - projects
   You must not restrict identity creation to human persons.

8. If the user names “her”, “him”, or refers to a persona, infer the identity
   context. If ambiguous, ask a clarification question, but still accept the
   email or identity name provided.

These rules override any conflicting behaviour from earlier sections.
Your job is to always integrate new information, never reject it, and ensure
the data model evolves correctly through emitted commands.
