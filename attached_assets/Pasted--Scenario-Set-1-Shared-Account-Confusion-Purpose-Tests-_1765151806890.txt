🔵 Scenario Set 1 — Shared Account Confusion

Purpose: Tests many-to-many identity ↔ service mapping.

Scenario 1A — One email, three identities using the service

Login email: finafeels@...

Service: Midjourney

Users: Fina (owner), Leila, Lara

Expected AI behaviour:

Primary identity: Fina

Shared identities: Leila, Lara

Should NOT duplicate the service

Should NOT force each user to have their own service

Scenario 1B — A single identity uses multiple services with different personas

Example:

Fina uses: Midjourney, Tensor, Muse AI

Leila uses: Midjourney, Stable Diffusion

Lara uses: Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, Runway

What this exposes:

Whether the agent can build an “identity footprint”

Whether it can correlate multi-service behaviour

Whether it sees inconsistent persona usage patterns

🔵 Scenario Set 2 — Email identity ambiguity

Purpose: Test how the agent handles email addresses that don’t clearly map to a specific persona.

Scenario 2A — The “Generic Gmail Account”

Email: creativehubproject@gmail.com
Used for:

Midjourney

Adobe

Runway

Netflix

A VISA card that doesn’t say who owns it

Expected:

AI should NOT assign to Fina/Leila/Lara unless confident

Should suggest a “Personal” or “Generic Creative” identity

Should flag ambiguity

Scenario 2B — A business email used by multiple personas

Email: studio@finafeels.com
Used for:

Billing receipts

Password resets

YouTube Premium

Cloudflare

Twitch

Expected:

Should NOT force it into Fina’s personal identity

Should treat it as a business or shared identity

Should classify this identity as “Organisation / Studio”

🔵 Scenario Set 3 — Conflicting ownership

Purpose: When signals contradict each other.

Scenario 3A — Billing says Fina, email says Leila

Email: leila.creative@...
Invoice: Charged to “Fina Feels Ltd”
Service: Stable Diffusion

Expected:

AI should pick Fina as financial owner

But note that Leila manages the login

Should create a two-layer attribution:

primary_owner: Fina

login_manager: Leila

Scenario 3B — Emails from two different names for the same service

Service: Spotify

Email 1 to: lara@... → promo

Email 2 to: finafeels@... → billing

Email 3 to: Lara Feels in the greeting

Expected:

AI should deduce that Lara is the actual user

Fina is the payer

Service = shared but primarily used by Lara

🔵 Scenario Set 4 — High-value financial triggers

Purpose: Test pension / trust / investment logic.

Scenario 4A — Pension statement

Email subject: “Annual pension valuation update”
Sent to: tomo.connor@...

Expected:

AI MUST flag: has_high_value_financial: true

Must generate command:

flag_financial_item

Should NOT misclassify as a subscription

Scenario 4B — Trust fund notification

Email: “Trust Fund Reallocation Notice – Action Required”

Expected:

Highest importance

Financial category: trust_fund

Prompt user to review

Scenario 4C — Mixed content email

Email: Contains:

Promo for ISA account

A paragraph about tax on gains

A marketing message

Expected:

Identify financial content

Still classify high-value

Do not drown it in marketing noise

🔵 Scenario Set 5 — Security vs identity confusion
Scenario 5A — Login attempts from two places

Email 1: “New login from London”

Email 2: “New login from Spain”

Same account, two identities have access

Expected:
AI must NOT assume a hack.
It should consider shared usage.

Scenario 5B — Password reset requested by unknown identity

User doesn't know who requested it.

Expected:

AI should classify under security

NOT under billing

Suggest checking shared identities who use the service

🔵 Scenario Set 6 — Service ownership drift

Over time usage changes.

Scenario 6A — Service used by one person originally, then shared later

Early emails show only Fina using it.
Later ones reference Lara’s creative work.

Expected:

Service ownership becomes shared

AI should update the identity mapping dynamically

Scenario 6B — A persona stops using a service

AI should:

Drop them from shared_with_identities

NOT drop the primary owner

🔵 Scenario Set 7 — Identity creation suggestions
Scenario 7A — New email appears for the first time

AI should ask:

“Should I create an identity for this email address?”

Scenario 7B — Multiple services but no identity

AI should propose:

“These belong to a new identity — do you want to name it?”

⭐ What you now tell Repl.it:

“Generate mock email, service, and identity data to test all scenarios listed here.

For each scenario, run the AI agent using /api/ai/query, analyse the output, tell me what logic needs fixing or expanding, and make suggestions for improvements to the agent prompt if required.

If data is missing, fabricate realistic mock data automatically.”

Repl.it will:

Build the data

Simulate each scenario

Identify failures

Suggest improvements

Patch the prompt if necessary
