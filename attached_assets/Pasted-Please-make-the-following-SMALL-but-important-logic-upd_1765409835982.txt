Please make the following SMALL but important logic updates to ensure that billing information for each Service uses a single source of truth everywhere in the system.

This is NOT a refactor.  
Do NOT restructure files or rename major components.  
Just unify how billing fields are stored and referenced.

----------------------------------------------
1. DEFINE THE SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH
----------------------------------------------

Each Service object must have ONE authoritative set of billing fields:

- cost
- currency
- billingCycle  (monthly/yearly/weekly/etc)
- nextBillingDate

These fields on the Service model must be the ONLY place that billing information is stored and updated.

This means:
- Manual edits in the UI update these fields.
- Email scanning (when implemented later) must update these same fields.
- The "Upcoming bills" logic must read from these same fields.
- ANY function or UI component that needs billing info must read from these fields.

No duplicate billing fields should exist in:
- Profiles
- Email accounts
- Local UI copies
- Legacy service fields (if any)

----------------------------------------------
2. WHEN EDITING A SERVICE (ANYWHERE)
----------------------------------------------

All edits to billing fields must update the SAME service model fields:

- Editing cost → updates service.cost
- Editing cycle → updates service.billingCycle
- Editing next bill date → updates service.nextBillingDate

Do NOT store temporary or local versions of these fields outside of the canonical Service object.

----------------------------------------------
3. WHEN DISPLAYING BILLING INFO
----------------------------------------------

All UI components must read billing info from the Service model only.

Examples:
- Profile → Services list
- ServiceDetailsModal
- Upcoming subscriptions widget
- Any future billing summaries

Ensure all of them read from:
- service.cost
- service.billingCycle
- service.nextBillingDate
- service.currency

Do NOT reconstruct billing info or fetch it from other places.

----------------------------------------------
4. WHEN ROLLING FORWARD `nextBillingDate`
----------------------------------------------

When you apply billing cycle rollover logic:

- The rollover must update `service.nextBillingDate` directly.
- No UI-level copies.
- No shadow fields.
- The updated value must be persisted back to the canonical Service record.

----------------------------------------------
5. HANDLING MULTIPLE SERVICE INSTANCES
----------------------------------------------

If there are multiple Service entries for the same provider but different login emails:

Example:
- Midjourney + tommo231@gmail.com
- Midjourney + finafeels@gmail.com

Each combination must have its own independent canonical billing fields.

The source of truth is:
(service name + loginEmail)

NOT:
(service name alone)

----------------------------------------------
6. AFTER IMPLEMENTATION, PLEASE CONFIRM:
----------------------------------------------

1. All components fetch billing info from Service model fields.
2. Editing a service updates the same canonical fields used everywhere.
3. No duplicate copies of cost/cycle/nextBillingDate exist in UI or backend.
4. Rollover logic writes back to the same canonical fields.
5. New services created through the UI store all billing info in the same place.
