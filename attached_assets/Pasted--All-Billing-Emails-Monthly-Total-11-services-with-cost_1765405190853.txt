what are profiles for and how are they helpful for me

22:18
Profiles are a way to tell the system **who** is actually using or connected to a service, separate from just who pays the bill or which email it’s under.

In your data, you can see `profileIds` on services like Midjourney, YouTube Premium, Cloudflare, Easy Split, etc. Those `profileIds` link each service back to one or more identities (like Tommo, Tommo Dev, Easy Split). That’s what profiles are doing under the hood.

How this helps you:

1. **Separates “who pays” from “who uses”**  
   - Example: Spotify Premium (for Lara) is paid by Fina but used by Lara. Profiles let us record that clearly: 
     - Financial owner: Fina (payer)  
     - Profile/user: Lara (listener)  
   This makes it easy to answer questions like “What do I pay for that’s actually for other people?”

2. **Gives you an identity footprint across services**  
   Because each service has `profileIds`, I can show you, for example:  
   - Tommo’s footprint: Midjourney, Tensor Art, Muse AI, Bean Counter, Test services, etc.  
   - Tommo Dev’s footprint: YouTube Premium, Cloudflare, Twitch.  
   - Easy Split’s footprint: Render, Firebase, GitHub.  
   That helps you see which identities/brands are using which tools, and how much each “persona” costs per month.

3. **Handles shared or generic accounts cleanly**  
   - You have a shared "Creative Hub (Shared)" identity that owns Adobe and Netflix, and also new services like NewService AI.  
   Profiles let us attach that single shared identity to multiple services instead of duplicating them per person, and still mark them as ambiguous/collective rather than personal.

4. **Supports more accurate cost breakdowns**  
   Because services know which profile(s) they’re linked to, you can ask:  
   - “How much does Tommo spend per month?”  
   - “What are the monthly costs attached to Easy Split?”  
   and I can use those profile links to calculate those numbers correctly.

5. **Makes future organisation and automation easier**  
   Profiles are the hook for:  
   - Grouping notifications, receipts, and security alerts by identity.  
   - Spotting ownership drift (e.g., Runway started for Fina but is now clearly Lara’s tool).  
   - Planning clean separations between personal, studio, and project spending.

In short: profiles are the **identity layer** on top of your services. They let us answer “which persona / business / project is this really for?” and then slice your spending, security events, and tools around that, instead of everything just being a flat list of subscriptions under a couple of emails.

If you’d like, I can walk through one of your identities (e.g., Tommo Dev or Easy Split) and show you its current profile footprint and monthly cost based on these links.
