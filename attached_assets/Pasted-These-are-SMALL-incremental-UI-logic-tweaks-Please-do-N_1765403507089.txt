These are SMALL, incremental UI/logic tweaks.  
Please do NOT treat this as a big refactor or migration.  
Just adjust the existing implementation for Profiles/Services.

CHANGES TO MAKE:

1) EMAIL ACCOUNTS SECTION IN PROFILE CARD

On the Profile (Identities → Profiles) page, in the “Email Accounts” area:

- Remove the idea of a “Primary” email:
  - Delete the "Primary" badge from email cards.
  - Remove any special logic that marks an email as primary for a profile.

- Each email in this section should simply support:
  - email address
  - optional description / “reason used” text underneath (e.g. "GitHub & Render", "Firebase frontend").

- The existing description text (e.g. "Primary - GitHub & Render", "Firebase Frontend") should be treated as the “reason used” field.
  - If possible, strip the word "Primary - " when it exists and keep only "GitHub & Render".
  - Make this description editable in the UI.

2) SERVICES LIST IN PROFILE CARD

The current layout for Services in a Profile (e.g. Render / Firebase / GitHub with email, website, price, status) is GOOD.

- Do NOT redesign this section.
- Keep:
  - service name
  - login email
  - website (domain)
  - cost and billing cycle
  - status
  - delete icon

Leave “Add services to this profile” behaviour as it is (linking existing services). The only changes below relate to the **New Service** form and underlying fields.

3) NEW SERVICE MODAL / FORM TWEAKS

In the “New Service” modal, adjust the form fields as follows.

a) Category field
- Change Category from a free-text field to a dropdown/select.
- Use a fixed set of categories, for example:
  - Infrastructure
  - AI Tools
  - Development
  - Entertainment
  - Finance
  - Productivity
  - Social / Marketing
  - Other
- Keep it easy to extend in code, but the UI should present a select, not a free text input.

b) Handle / username
- Keep the "handle / username" field, but make sure it is NOT required.
- The user must be able to create a service without providing a handle/user.
- Confirm validation allows this to be empty.

c) Linked profiles
- The “Linked Profiles” multi-select is good, but:
  - The current profile (the one the user is on when they click “New Service”) should:
    - be pre-selected by default
    - appear at the top of the list, and if possible be visually marked (e.g. "(current profile)").
  - On submit:
    - The new service’s `profileIds` MUST include the current profile’s id by default.

d) Login email vs billing email
- Remove any “Select billing email” field from the New Service form.
- The only email we care about here is **loginEmail**.
- For the login email input:
  - Allow the user to type any email address (free text).
  - Optionally, you may provide suggestions/autocomplete based on known emails in the system, but it must NOT be restricted to a fixed dropdown.
- Make sure the Service model and API DO NOT require a separate `billingEmail`; use `loginEmail` as the canonical email.

e) Billing date field
- Add an optional field to represent when the next bill is due.
  - Label: “Next bill due” (or similar).
  - This should be a date input (or date picker).
- In the Service model, add an optional field:
  - `nextBillingDate?: string`  // ISO date string
- Do NOT run a destructive migration; just support this field when it is present.

f) Status options
- Update the status dropdown for a Service.
- Valid options should be:
  - active
  - cancelled
  - trial
  - archived
- Remove or rename any "expired" option to "archived" in both the UI and underlying types/enums.

g) Notes
- Ensure the New Service form has an “Additional notes” field (textarea).
- This should map to the Service model’s `notes` field and be editable.

4) GENERAL CLEANUP OF BILLING VS LOGIN

Across the codebase related to this feature:

- Search for any leftover uses of:
  - `billingEmail`
  - `billing_email`
  - "billing email" copy in the UI

- For this feature set, standardise on:
  - `loginEmail` as the canonical email field on the Service model.
- If older fields exist AND are still needed for backward compatibility, treat them as aliases:
  - Never overwrite `loginEmail` with a billing email value.
  - For the New Service UX specifically, do not show or require any billing-email-specific UI controls.

5) BE CAREFUL NOT TO BREAK EXISTING LAYOUT

- Keep the current Profiles (Identities) card aesthetic and layout.
- Only make the changes described above:
  - Email Accounts -> remove “Primary” and treat subtext as “reason used”.
  - New Service modal -> adjust fields and options as specified.
- Do NOT restructure navigation, routing, or overall page layouts.

After implementing, please:
- Confirm that:
  - I can add a new service with only: name, category, loginEmail, website, cost, billing cycle, status, notes and linked profiles (with current profile pre-selected).
  - Handle/username AND Next bill due are optional.
  - “Primary” no longer appears on email accounts; instead, I just see the email address and its description.
- Briefly summarise which files you changed.
